Experimental Setup :
	We used two laptops connected via ethernet cables through a D-Link router to act as server and client.
	The specifications of the systems and network link is mentioned in the report.
	We have used the client in random mode.

Compiling the code :
	We have provided a makefile to compile the server
	Writing 'make' in the submitted directory like compile the code and 
	generate the executables 'server-mt'

Running the server :
	./server-mp <port> <num-threads> <queue-size>
